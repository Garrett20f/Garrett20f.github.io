*Adventure: a thing that is hard to accomplish.*

Go adventure and find yourself in the wild. It is so much fun and you will enjoy it so much. I like hiking in the forest here in hawaii for example. There is much to see and do while hiking. I like to take pictures of plants and birds when I hike. I also like to freedive for adventures. I ussally go to electric beach and see turtles and many fish. I also have seen a shark once and a eel. 

## In the context of fun

I love to go adventure around whenever I get a chance. I love to go hike and fish. My favorite place to fish is electric beach.
