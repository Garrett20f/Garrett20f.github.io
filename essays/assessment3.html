  <p>My web application system is a store that sells energy drinks.</p>

<p>I was not able to implement a timeout during the users shopping session. This was very challenging and I struggled to add this to my web application.</p>

<p>I am most proud of my invoice. This is because my invoice has the ability to send the invoice to the userâ€™s email address after a successful purchase.</p>

<p>I am least satisfied with my login page as it meets the requirements however its not as aesthetically pleasing as some of my other pages.</p>

<p>It was different from assignment 2 as it required me to change from storing the users data in local storage to storing it in the session.</p>

<p>I tried to take a step back to what I implemented last and then try and see what I added that might have caused the problem and then run it on a browser to see if there is an error in the console.</p>

<p>What worked well in this assignment was the invoice. I loved how it turned out and that I was able to send this page to someone by email using the nodemailer.</p>

<p>What did not work well in this assignment was the login and registration page as they were not as aesthetically pleasing as some of the other pages.</p>

<p>I learned how to send an email using the nodemailer and how to store the users data in the session.</p>

<p>If I could go back in time and do things differently I would change the login and registration pages to be created on the server.</p>

<p>I spent about 40% of my time thinking about how to do something. I spent about 30% of my time writing code. I spent about 20% of my time testing and debugging.</p>

<p>I choose to work on assignment 3 on my own so that I could challenge myself as well as only have one individual requirement.</p>
