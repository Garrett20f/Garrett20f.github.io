*UI Basics Technical Essay WOD1-WOD3.*

## WOD 1

I didn't have a single clue where to begin for browser history 1 WOD. I attempted to start it on my own however I didn't get very far and spent way too much time trying to figure it out. I then went on to watch the screencast solution and went through it step by step. I realized however that watching the screen cast was not very useful and went back through it and took notes. I also realized that having the pages that were needed to be copied already and available saved a lot of time. I learned a lot about HTML and how to add links to my web page. I finished in about 28 minutes the first two times and then after taking notes I finished in 16 minutes then finally in 15 minutes. 

My advice would be to not just watch the screencast solution first and copy the code because you will not learn very much. I would suggest taking notes while watching the screen cast solution as it will help you a lot more than just trying to copy the code. 


## WOD 2

I wasn't able to figure out where to start for browser history 2 and spent way too much time trying to figure out what to do. I went on and watched the screencast solution and took very thorough notes. I also kept my google font reading resource open for references and also to copy the link to add my Oswald font to my web page. It took me 5 attempts to complete the Browser history 6 WOD. I finally was able to finish my last attempt in 7 minutes. I learned how to add google fonts to my webpage. 

My advice would be to not watch the screen cast first and try to copy the code. This will waste a lot of time and learn nothing. Instead I would take very good notes that can be used for reference when trying to complete your WOD. 

## WOD 3

I wasn't able to figure out where to start for browser history 3 and spent a lot of time trying to figure out where to begin. I then proceeded to watch the screencast solution and take extremely thorough notes to help me later on. I had my instructions opened up next to me so it was easy to read and access the necessary material. It took me 5 tries but I eventually was able to finish in under 14 minutes. I learned a lot about how to style a css sheet.  

My advice would be to not just watch the screen cast and try to copy the code on your computer. This will waste a lot of time and you will learn absolutely nothing. Instead I would take very good notes that can be used for reference when trying to complete your WOD.
