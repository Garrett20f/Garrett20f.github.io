My web application system is a store that sells energy drinks. 


I was not able to implement a timeout during the users shopping session. This was very challenging and I struggled to add this to my web application. 


I am most proud of my invoice. This is because my invoice has the ability to send the invoice to the user's email address after a successful purchase. 


I am least satisfied with my login page as it meets the requirements however its not as aesthetically pleasing as some of my other pages.  


It was different from assignment 2 as it required me to change from storing the users data in local storage to storing it in the session. 


I tried to take a step back to what I implemented last and then try and see what I added that might have caused the problem and then run it on a browser to see if there is an error in the console. 


What worked well in this assignment was the invoice. I loved how it turned out and that I was able to send this page to someone by email using the nodemailer. 


What did not work well in this assignment was the login and registration page as they were not as aesthetically pleasing as some of the other pages. 


I learned how to send an email using the nodemailer and how to store the users data in the session. 


If I could go back in time and do things differently I would change the login and registration pages to be created on the server. 


I spent about 40% of my time thinking about how to do something. I spent about 30% of my time writing code. I spent about 20% of my time testing and debugging. 


I choose to work on assignment 3 on my own so that I could challenge myself as well as only have one individual requirement.
